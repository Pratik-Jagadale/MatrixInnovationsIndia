        <p><b>Your dream, Our Creation!</b> <br /><br />

            <b>Our Story :</b><br />

            It all started back in 2021, November - "mAtrix 4.0".<br />

            We all are Astromedicomp's RTR (Real Time Rendering), 4th batch's students.<br />
            Matrix was our group name which was inspired from the mathematical concept "matrices".<br />
            From "Matrix Group" to "MatrixInnovations" we grew.<br />
            The journey right from a basic triangle to special effects encouraged us to build something of our
            own!<br />
            We dare to live by the 4 P's - Passion, Patience, Persistence and Perfection. And here we are
            today!<br /><br />

            <b>Our speciality :</b><br />

            <b>OpenGL -</b><br />
            OpenGL is a graphics library which communicates with Graphics Card and creates 2D/3D images/videos on
            monitor.<br />
            All 3D graphics softwares like Blender, Maya, AutoCAD uses OpenGL beneath.<br />
            We can create special effects in movies like Avatar, Jurassic Park, Avengers using openGL.<br />
            Also, scientific visualizations in medical field, digital image processing uses OpenGL.<br />
            It would not be a wrong statement if we say - "OpenGL open the gates to the magic!".<br />

            <p>Sir always tells students that movies, like Jurrassic Park, Avatar are made with those softwares which
                has OpenGL at their core technology.
                As it is said ... "Low Aim Is Crime"... we have dared to recreate a tiny world of ours resembling to
                that of James Cameron's Avatar, and
                present it to one of our dearest group member, Sahil Choure, on occasion of his birthday.</p>

            <h3>Deepostav</h3>
            <p>Celebration of Lights and victory of good over evil and darkness - is the ultimate definition of the
                ancient Hindu festival - “Deepavali” (दीपावली), also known as “Deepotsav” (दीपोत्सव).

                The word “Deepotsav” (दीपोत्सव) is a combination of two words :- “Deep” (दीप) and “Utsav” (उत्सव).
                “Deep” (दीप) is the Sanskrit word for 'a flaming light', and “Utsav” (उत्सव) means 'celebration'.</p>

            <h3>Movie Time - Avatar Way of Water</h3>
            <p>Avatar way of water was released while our WebGL project was going on. And we could not see because the
                project was going on. Then we completed the project one day before the project submission date and went
                to the movie.
                so we delivered the project before time. and we celebrate our success.</p>
